## Description
Calming Corner is an interactive application designed to help children under 10 years old who struggle with self-regulating emotions. While its primary audience is children, anyone can benefit from its engaging activities. 
The app features a variety of interactive activities aimed at promoting calmness and emotional regulation.

One of the key features of Calming Corner is its digital fidget spinner, offering three different style options to suit individual preferences. 
This interactive spinner provides a soothing experience, allowing users to focus their attention and reduce anxiety.

Another activity included in Calming Corner is a physics-based game where users can manipulate small 2D orbs and watch them interact in a simulated environment. 
By crashing these orbs together, users can engage in a fun and calming activity that encourages relaxation and mindfulness.

Calming Corner strives to provide children with enjoyable tools to manage their emotions effectively, promoting a sense of calmness and well-being in their daily lives.
